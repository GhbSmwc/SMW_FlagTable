<center><h1>Memory-based Conditional map 16 blocks</h1></center>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This ASM resource allows you to have more than 128 bit flags in your entire game. This is useful for exploration-based hacks should you have blocks that
shouldn't respawn when the player refreshes the level.<br><br>

Note that this isn't really a <b>true</b> conditional map 16 expansion, this is because this ASM resource relies on Lunar Magic's conditional map16 blocks
(<kbd>$7FC060</kbd> to <kbd>$7FC06F</kbd>), therefore, you can use up to 128 flags per level. This ASM resource just creates a new RAM area defined as
<kbd>!Freeram_MemoryFlag</kbd> and &ldquo;divide&rdquo; them into groups of 16 bytes. Depending on what level you are in, all 16 bytes within a specified
group (set by the table) will copy itself into <kbd>$7FC060</kbd>-<kbd>$7FC06F</kbd> to make the blocks spawn, not spawn anymore, or remain changed when
the player leaves and return.</p>
